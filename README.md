# Gamify

A competitive learning platform. An admin creates a "game" with term/definition pairs; participants join via a 6-character share code and compete on a live leaderboard by earning points through a Quizlet-style **Learn** mode, daily **Quizzes**, and daily **Tests**. First use case: memorizing Bible verses with family and friends.

- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Backend:** Express, deployed as a Vercel serverless function
- **Database:** Supabase (Postgres) — used for data only; no Supabase Auth
- **Auth:** phone number only (no password, no SMS verification for MVP)

---

## 1. Run it locally

### Prerequisites
- Node 18+
- A free Supabase project (https://supabase.com)

### Steps
1. **Install deps**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create your Supabase project**
   - In Supabase, open **SQL editor**.
   - Paste the contents of `schema.sql` and run.
   - Paste the contents of `seed.sql` and run (creates a sample Bible-verse game with share code `BIBLE1`).
   - **Upgrading an existing DB from an older schema?** Just re-run `schema.sql`. It's idempotent — every `CREATE TABLE` uses `IF NOT EXISTS`, missing columns are added via `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, and the `users.phone` unique constraint is backfilled by a guarded `DO` block. Drift is what caused the "cards disappear after creating a game" class of bug; see Troubleshooting §6.
   - **Disable RLS on every table.** The API uses the service-role key (which bypasses RLS), and no client ever talks to Supabase directly. Leaving RLS enabled with no policies will silently drop writes from any other key:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE users                DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
     ALTER TABLE games                DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
     ALTER TABLE pairs                DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
     ALTER TABLE memberships          DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
     ALTER TABLE points_ledger        DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
     ALTER TABLE quiz_attempts        DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
     ALTER TABLE test_attempts        DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
     ALTER TABLE learn_runs           DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
     ALTER TABLE daily_question_sets  DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
     ALTER TABLE daily_rank_snapshots DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
     ALTER TABLE activity_log         DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
     ```

3. **Configure env vars**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Fill in:
   - `SUPABASE_URL` — from Supabase **Settings → API → Project URL**
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — from Supabase **Settings → API → service_role** (server-only; never expose to the browser)

4. **Start dev (frontend + API in parallel)**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - API: http://localhost:3001 (Vite proxies `/api/*` to it)

5. **Try it**
   - Sign in with any phone number (e.g. `4045551234`). First-time users are prompted for first/last name.
   - On the hub, click **Join with code** and enter `BIBLE1` to drop into the sample game.
   - Or click **+ Create new Gamify** to make your own.

## 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Vercel: **New Project → Import** the repo. Framework preset: **Other** (Vercel auto-detects Vite).
3. **Environment Variables** (Project Settings → Environment Variables):
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
4. Deploy. Vercel runs `vite build` and serves:
   - `dist/` as the static site
   - `api/index.js` as a serverless function (Express) — `vercel.json` rewrites `/api/*` to it and all other paths to `index.html` for client routing.

That's it. No build server, no extra config.

## 4. How the major features work

### Auth (intentionally minimal for MVP)
- Login is by phone number only. Numbers are normalized (`(404) 555-1234`, `404-555-1234`, `+1 404 555 1234`, and `4045551234` all collapse to `4045551234`).
- If the normalized phone exists, the user logs in **and their saved name comes back with them** — they don't re-enter it. Otherwise a new row is created, and the user is asked for first/last name.
- The DB enforces `unique(phone)` so a single phone always resolves to a single user. As a belt-and-suspenders measure for any DB that's missing the constraint, `POST /api/auth/login` picks the canonical row (prefers one with a complete profile, then the oldest) and merges any duplicates' memberships / points / activity into it before deleting them — see `mergeUserInto` in `api/_app.js`.
- The session is persisted in `localStorage`. Each API call sends `X-User-Id`. To swap in real SMS verification later, replace `POST /api/auth/login`.

### Daily Quizzes & Tests
- 5-question quiz; 20-question test. One attempt per user per day per game (locked once taken).
- The question set is **frozen per day**: the first user to open today's quiz/test triggers a server-side build (seeded by `kind + gameId + ET-date`), and the result is stored in `daily_question_sets` so that mid-day pair edits don't change what's already been answered. No cron job — the row is created lazily.
- If the game has fewer than 5 / 20 pairs, the corresponding feature shows a clean "Not enough content yet" state.
- Day boundaries everywhere are **US Eastern**.

### Learn engine (highest-priority correctness)
Each card has a progression state per run:
- `phase`: `'mc'` or `'tio'`
- `missedInPhase`: have they missed this card in the current phase?
- `consecutiveCorrect`: streak in this phase
- `mastered`, `paidOut`: terminal flags

Rules implemented exactly per spec:
- MC correct on first try → graduates to TIO.
- MC missed → must get correct **twice in a row** to graduate.
- TIO correct on first try → Mastered.
- TIO missed → must get correct **twice in a row** to be Mastered.

Sessions are 10 cards. After answering, the card (if not mastered) is re-appended to the queue with its updated phase/state. The post-session screen shows X/10 correct, a smoothed bar chart over the last 5 sessions, an estimated-minutes-remaining stat, and the Mastered / Learning / To Be Learned buckets.

**Scoring:** a fully completed run is worth exactly **50 points**, split evenly across all cards. Each card pays `50 / total` when it Masters. Exiting mid-run banks only the cards that have already Mastered; resuming pays the remaining slices so the run still totals exactly 50.

**Reset on completion:** when all cards Master, the run state is cleared and a new run can begin. Unlimited runs per day. 10 completed runs = 500 points.

**Type-it-out leniency:** lowercased, punctuation/whitespace stripped, then compared with normalized Levenshtein. Threshold lives in `src/config.js` (`SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.9`). After grading:
- Marked incorrect → show user's answer in red, correct answer in green, one button "I was actually correct".
- Marked correct but not exact match → show in green, one button "I was actually incorrect".
- Exact match → green only, no override button.

### Leaderboard
- Live polling every 5 seconds.
- Ranks 1/2/3 use grayscale medal SVGs (single-color theme); ranks 4+ show the numeric rank.
- Daily delta vs the snapshot taken at first leaderboard access each ET day (lazy snapshot — no cron required).

### Profile
- Name, tier, total points.
- Monthly calendar: a square per day, filled solid green (with a white number) if the user made any progress that day (quiz, test, or any Learn answer).
- Weekly streak: shown two ways — a large numeric count of consecutive Sun–Sat ET weeks with at least one active day, and a vertical rail to the right of the calendar that puts a green dot next to every active week and a connecting green bar between consecutive active weeks. Inactive weeks show nothing on the rail. The rail is centered between the calendar's right edge and the card's right padding.

### Game creation
- Title + 5 blank rows on the content page, with `+ Add 5 more` and per-row delete. A "Paste from a spreadsheet" textarea ingests tab-separated `term<TAB>definition` lines in one shot — malformed lines are added but visually flagged so the user can fix them before saving.
- Prompt direction is no longer a per-game setting: each card in Learn / Quiz / Test is randomly presented term-first or definition-first. The `games.direction` column is preserved for backward compatibility and is always written as `'term'`.
- Logo is an auto-generated monogram (first letter of the title in a black circle).
- The admin can **edit** existing pairs and **soft-delete** them via the "Edit Pairs" modal (sidebar). Edits and deletes only affect FUTURE Learn runs and FUTURE days — active Learn runs use the term/definition text snapshotted at run start, and today's quiz/test is frozen in `daily_question_sets`. Newly added pairs join everyone's "To Be Learned" set the next run.

## 5. Tuning constants

All tunable values are in `src/config.js`:

```js
QUIZ_LENGTH, QUIZ_MAX_POINTS   // 5, 5
TEST_LENGTH, TEST_MAX_POINTS   // 20, 20
LEARN_RUN_POINTS               // 50
TIER_THRESHOLDS                // [100, 200, 350, 600] — four cut points → five tiers
TIERS                          // Master, Veteran, Elite, Professional, Rookie (top-to-bottom)
CARDS_PER_SESSION              // 10
MC_OPTION_COUNT                // 4
EST_SECONDS_PER_MC             // 10
EST_SECONDS_PER_TIO            // 30
RECENT_SESSIONS_CHART_COUNT    // 5
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD           // 0.9
SHARE_CODE_LENGTH              // 6
APP_TIMEZONE                   // 'America/New_York'
```

The server has a mirror of these constants in `api/_lib/config.js` — keep the two in sync if you change values.

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **"Server is missing SUPABASE_URL …"** — `.env` not loaded. Make sure you ran `cp .env.example .env` and filled it in, and that you started the dev server with `npm run dev` (which loads `.env` via dotenv).
- **"Not in this game"** when opening a game — the share code is wrong, or the user hasn't joined. Use the join screen to enter the code.
- **Quiz says "Not enough content yet"** — the game needs at least 5 pairs (or 20 for a test). The admin can use **Edit Pairs** in the sidebar.
- **Calendar/streak looks off** — day boundaries are US Eastern. A late-night activity counts toward the ET date it occurred on.
- **A game shows 0 cards even though you added some / Edit Pairs is empty / Quiz says "Have 0 of 20"** — schema drift. The deployed DB is missing a column or table that the API queries. Almost always one of:
  - `pairs.deleted_at` doesn't exist (every pair-read filters `is('deleted_at', null)`).
  - `daily_question_sets` table doesn't exist (today's quiz/test can't be frozen).

  Fix: re-run `schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor. It's idempotent and will backfill anything missing. If you want to confirm before re-running, this query shows what's there:
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='pairs' AND column_name='deleted_at';
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='daily_question_sets';
  ```
  After the bug fix above, the API now wraps every pair-read in `expectRead()` (see `api/_lib/util.js`), so any future schema-mismatch read error will throw a real error in the server log and the UI instead of silently rendering an empty list.
- **Writes appear to succeed but no rows appear in the DB** — your `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` env var is set to the **anon** key, not the **service-role** key. With RLS enabled and no policies (Supabase's default for new tables), the anon key silently produces 0 rows on insert/update. Decode the JWT body at jwt.io: it must show `"role":"service_role"`. The right service-role key lives in Supabase **Project Settings → API → service_role** (red "secret" badge). The other guardrail is to disable RLS on every table per the setup instructions in §1 — the API is the only client and uses the service-role key.
- **User keeps getting re-prompted for first/last name after signing in with the same phone** — the DB is missing the `unique(phone)` constraint on `users`, so duplicates accumulated and login was returning a different row each time. Re-running `schema.sql` will add the constraint (the script's guarded `DO` block handles the existing-data case). The login endpoint also merges duplicates on the fly, so the next sign-in will heal the data automatically.
